/**
 * This class takes care of the players current failCount (Number of times they've failed in a minigame).
 * And the purpose of the failCount is ultimately for the highscore, since it increases the playtime as a punishment.
 * In order to make the current failCount visible to the player, JavaFX needs an IntegerProperty to bind it to
 * the respective Label afterwards. The failCount Label updates itself whenever the failCount increases.
 *
 * Since IntegerProperty in itself is not {@link Serializable}, it was needed to create a seperate class to define
 * write and readExternal methods to save it into an .ser file afterwards. It is being converted into an int value for saving,
 * and the integer is being written back into the IntegerProperty Object by loading a player file.
